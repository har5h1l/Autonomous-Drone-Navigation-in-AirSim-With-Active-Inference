┌ Warning: Assignment to `all_packages_loaded` in soft scope is ambiguous because a global variable by the same name exists: `all_packages_loaded` will be treated as a new local. Disambiguate by using `local all_packages_loaded` to suppress this warning or `global all_packages_loaded` to assign to the existing global variable.
